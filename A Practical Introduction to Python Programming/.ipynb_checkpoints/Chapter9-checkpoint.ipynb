For instance, gcd(18, 42) is 6 because the largest number that both 18 and 42 are divisible by is 6. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and computes their gcd. Shown below is a way to compute the GCD, called Euclid’s Algorithm. • First compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number • Next, replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder. • Repeat this process until the smaller number is 0. The GCD is the last value of the larger number."
